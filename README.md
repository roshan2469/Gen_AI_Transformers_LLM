# Introduction to Generative AI and Transformer Architectures
Overview

This notebook provides a structured exploration of Generative AI, Transformer models, and Large Language Models (LLMs). It explains foundational concepts behind attention mechanisms, tokenization, embeddings, and model scaling.

The project references architectures such as GPT, BERT, and T5 to demonstrate encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder frameworks.
